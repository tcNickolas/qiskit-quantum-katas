    "\n",
    "You are given a classical function that takes one bit as an input and returns one bit: $f(x): \\{0, 1\\} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$. You are guaranteed that the function $f$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "- either *constant* (returns the same value for all inputs) \n",
    "- or *variable* (returns different values for different inputs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to figure out whether the function is constant or variable. In other words, you need to decide whether $f(0) = f(1)$ (which is the same as the function being constant for single-bit functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f(x) \\equiv 0$ or $f(x) \\equiv 1$ are constant functions (and they are actually the only constant functions in existence).\n",
    "- $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = 1 - x$ are the only variable functions (and they are the only variable functions for single-bit functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you solve this problem classically, how many calls to the given function will you need? \n",
    "\n",
    "The first function call will give you no information - regardless of whether it returns $0$ or $1$, the function could still be constant or variable.\n",
    "You'll need to call the function a second time to evaluate its return values for both possible inputs to be able to check whether these values are equal.\n",

    "## Quantum functions: single-qubit oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "In the quantum scenario, the classical function you're working with is implemented as a quantum oracle - a \"black box\" operation used as input to another algorithm. This operation is implemented in a way which allows performing calculations not only on individual inputs, but also on superpositions of inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle has to act on quantum states instead of classical values. \n",
    "To enable this, integer input $x$ is represented as a single-qubit state $\\ket{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of oracles used in this tutorial are called *phase oracles*. A phase oracle $U_f$ encodes the value of the classical function $f$ it implements in the phase of the qubit state as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x} = (-1)^{f(x)} \\ket{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $f$ can return only two values, 0 or 1, which result in no phase change or multiplication by a relative phase $-1$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of such an oracle on any single basis state isn't particularly interesting: it just adds a global phase which isn't something you can observe. However, if you apply this oracle to a *superposition* of basis states, its effect becomes noticeable. \n",
    "Remember that quantum operations are linear: if you define the effect of an operation on the basis states, you'll be able to deduce its effect on superposition states (which are just linear combinations of the basis states) using its linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only four single-bit functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $f(x) \\equiv 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the easiest function to implement: if $f(x) \\equiv 0$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x} \\equiv (-1)^0 \\ket{x} = \\ket{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that $U_f$ is an identity - a transformation which does absolutely nothing! \n",
    "\n",
    "2. $f(x) \\equiv 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second constant function is slightly trickier: if $f(x) \\equiv 1$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x} \\equiv (-1)^1 \\ket{x} = - \\ket{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now $U_f$ is a negative identity, that is, a transformation which applies a global phase of $-1$ to the state. \n",
    "A lot of algorithms just ignore the global phase accumulated in them, since it isn't observable. \n",
    "However, if you want to be really meticulous, you can use a sequence of several single-qubit gates that, multiplied, produce a negative identity. One way to do it is to use the sequence of gates $ZXZX$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $f(x) = x$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x} = (-1)^{f(x)} \\ket{x} = (-1)^{x} \\ket{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you don't need to do anything if the qubit is in the $\\ket{0}$ state, and apply a phase of $-1$ if it is in the $\\ket{1}$ state. This is exactly the effect of the $Z$ gate!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $f(x) = 1 - x$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine the analysis for two previous cases to figure out the implementation for this phase oracle too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following demo, you'll see how to implement the first three one-bit functions as quantum oracles, and observe their effect on a qubit state.\n",
    "After that, you'll try to implement the oracle for the fourth function on your own!"
