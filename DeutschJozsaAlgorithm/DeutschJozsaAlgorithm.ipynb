    "You are given a classical function that takes an $N$-bit string as an input and returns one bit: $f(x): \\{0, 1\\}^N \\to \\{0, 1\\}$. You are guaranteed that the function $f$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "- either *constant* (returns the same value for all inputs) \n",
    "- or *balanced* (returns value $0$ for half of the inputs and $1$ for the other half of the inputs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to figure out whether the function is constant or balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f(x) \\equiv 0$ or $f(x) \\equiv 1$ are constant functions (and they're actually the only constant functions in existence).\n",
    "- $f(x) = x \\bmod 2$ (the least significant bit of $x$) or $f(x) = 1 \\text{ if the binary notation of }x \\text{ has odd number of 1s and 0 otherwise}$ are examples of multi-bit balanced functions. Indeed, for both these functions you can check that for every possible input $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$ there exists an input $x^\\prime$ (equal to $x$ with the least significant bit flipped) such that $f(x^\\prime) = 1$, and vice versa, which means that the function is balanced.\n",

    "In the best case scenario, the second call will return a different value. You'll be able to conclude that the function is balanced in just $2$ calls. \n",
    "However, if you get the same value for the first two calls, you'll have to keep querying the function until either the function returns a different value, or until you perform $2^{N-1}+1$ queries that return the same value - only in this case will you know with certainty that the function is constant.\n",

    "In the quantum scenario, the classical function you're working with is implemented as a quantum oracle - a \"black box\" operation used as input to another algorithm. This operation is implemented in a way which allows you to perform calculations not only on individual inputs, but also on superpositions of inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To enable the oracle to act on quantum states instead of classical values, the integer input $x$ is represented in binary $x = (x_{0}, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{N-1})$, \n",

    "\n",
    "The function $f$ can return only two values, 0 or 1, which result in no phase change or multiplication by a relative phase $-1$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of such an oracle on any single basis state isn't particularly interesting: it just adds a global phase which isn't something you can observe. However, if you apply this oracle to a *superposition* of basis states, its effect becomes noticeable. \n",
    "Remember that quantum operations are linear: if you define the effect of an operation on the basis states, you'll be able to deduce its effect on superposition states (which are just linear combinations of the basis states) using its linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to implement several examples of multi-bit constant and balanced functions as phase oracles in Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $f(x) \\equiv 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the easiest function to implement: if $f(x) \\equiv 0$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x} \\equiv (-1)^0 \\ket{x} = \\ket{x}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. $f(x) \\equiv 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second constant function is slightly trickier: if $f(x) \\equiv 1$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x} \\equiv (-1)^1 \\ket{x} = - \\ket{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now $U_f$ is a negative identity, that is, a transformation which applies a global phase of $-1$ to the state. \n",
    "A lot of algorithms just ignore the global phase accumulated in them, since it isn't observable. \n",
    "However, if you want to be really meticulous, you can use a sequence of several single-qubit gates that, multiplied, produce a negative identity. One way to do it is to use the sequence of gates $ZXZX$ applied to the same qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $f(x) = x \\bmod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary representation of $x$ is $x = (x_{0}, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{N-1})$, with the least significant bit encoded in the first bit (stored in the first qubit of the input array). Then you can rewrite the function as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = x_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this in the oracle effect expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\ket{x} = (-1)^{f(x)} \\ket{x} = (-1)^{x_0} \\ket{x} = (-1)^{x_0} \\ket{x_{0} } \\otimes \\ket{x_{1} } \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\ket{x_{N-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you only need to use the first qubit in the implementation: do nothing if it's $\\ket{0}$ and apply a phase of $-1$ if it's $\\ket{1}$. This is exactly the effect of the $Z$ gate!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write out the oracle unitary as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f = Z \\otimes \\mathbb{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\mathbb{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following demo, you'll see how to implement these three one-bit functions as quantum oracles, and observe their effect on a quantum state.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the number of bits in the oracle input $N$ and the oracle itself - a \"black box\" operation $U_f$ that implements a classical function $f(x)$. You are guaranteed that the function implemented by the oracle is either constant or balanced.\n",

    "### The starting state\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with $N$ qubits in the $\\ket{0...0} = \\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Apply Hadamard transform to each qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the $H$ gate to one qubit in the $\\ket{0}$ state converts it to the $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\big(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1} \\big)$ state, which is an equal superposition of both basis states on one qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you apply the $H$ gate to each of the two qubits in the $\\ket{00}$ state, you get \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(H \\otimes H) \\ket{00} = \\big(H \\ket{0} \\big) \\otimes \\big(H \\ket{0}\\big) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\big(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1} \\big)\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\big(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1} \\big)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\big(\\ket{00} + \\ket{01} + \\ket{10} + \\ket{11} \\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just an equal superposition of all basis states on two qubits! \n",
    "You can extend the same thinking to applying the $H$ gate to each of the $N$ qubits in the $\\ket{0...0}$ state to conclude that this transforms them into a state that is an equal superposition of all basis states on $N$ qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the transformation \"apply $H$ gate to each of the $N$ qubits\" can be denoted as $H^{\\otimes N}$. After applying this transformation, you get the following state:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 2. Apply the oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is the only step in which you use the knowledge of the classical function, given as the quantum oracle. \n",
    "This step keep the amplitudes of the basis states for which $f(x) = 0$ unchanged, and multiply the amplitudes of the basis states for which $f(x) = 1$ by $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the results of oracle application can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_f \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} \\ket{x} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} U_f\\ket{x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{f(x)} \\ket{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Apply Hadamard transform to each qubit again\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you don't need to worry about the whole expression for the state of the qubits after applying the $H$ gates to them; it's enough to calculate only the resulting amplitude of the basis state $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider one of the basis states $\\ket{x}$ in the expression $\\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{f(x)} \\ket{x}$.  \n",
    "It can be written as $\\ket{x} = \\ket{x_{0} } \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\ket{x_{N-1}}$, where each $\\ket{x_k}$ is either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$.  \n",
    "When you apply the $H$ gates to $\\ket{x}$, we'll get $H^{\\otimes N} \\ket{x} = H\\ket{x_{0} } \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes H\\ket{x_{N-1}}$, where each term of the tensor product is either $H\\ket{0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}\\big(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1} \\big) = \\ket{+}$ or $H\\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}\\big(\\ket{0} - \\ket{1} \\big) = \\ket{-}$. \n",
    "If you open the brackets in this tensor product, you get a superposition of all $N$-qubit basis states, each of them with amplitude $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}}$ or $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}}$ — and, since the amplitude of the $\\ket{0}$ state in both $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$ is positive, you know that the amplitude of the basis state $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$ ends up positive, that is, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can calculate the amplitude of the $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$ state in the expression $H^{\\otimes N} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{f(x)} \\ket{x} \\right)$: in each of the $2^N$ terms of the sum its amplitude is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}}$. Therefore, you get the total amplitude\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{f(x)} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^N}} = \\frac{1}{2^N} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{f(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4. Perform measurements and interpret the result\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you didn't use the fact that the function you are given is constant or balanced. Let's see how this affects the amplitude of the $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the function is constant, $f(x) = C$ (either always $0$ or always $1$), you get  \n",
    "  $$\\frac{1}{2^N} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{f(x)} = \\frac{1}{2^N} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{C} = \\frac{1}{2^N} \\cdot 2^N (-1)^C = (-1)^C$$\n",
    "  Since the sum of squares of amplitudes of all basis states always equals $1$, the amplitudes of the rest of the basis states have to be 0 - this means that the state of the qubits after step 3 *is* $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the function is balanced, that is, returns $0$ for exactly half of the inputs and $1$ for the other half of the inputs, exactly half of the terms in the sum $\\frac{1}{2^N} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^N-1} (-1)^{f(x)}$ will be $1$ and the other half of the terms will be $-1$, and they will all cancel out, leaving the amplitude of $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$ equal to $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what happens when you measure all qubits? (Remember that the probability of getting a certain state as a result of measurement equals to the square of the amplitude of this state.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function is constant, the only measurement result you can get is all zeros - the probability of getting any other result is $0$. If the function is balanced, the probability of getting all zeros is $0$, so you'll get any measurement result except this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the last step of the algorithm: **measure all qubits, if all measurement results are 0, the function is constant, otherwise it's balanced**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the algorithm is very straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply the $H$ gate to each qubit.\n",
    "2. Apply the oracle.\n",
    "3. Apply the $H$ gate to each qubit again.\n",
    "4. Measure all qubits.\n",
    "5. If all qubits are measured in $\\ket{0}$ state, the function is constant, otherwise it's balanced.\n",

    "Congratulations! In this kata you learned Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is the simplest example of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic algorithm for the same problem.\n",
    "- Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is a similar algorithm that extracts information about the hidden bit string of the given function that is known to be a scalar product function. It offers a linear speedup compared to a classical algorithm for the same problem.\n",
    "- Quantum oracles don't allow you to evaluate the function on all inputs at once! Instead, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm finds a clever way to aggregate information about all function values into a few bits that indicate whether they are all the same or not. Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm uses a similar approach to encode the information about the hidden bit string into the state of the qubits at the end of the algorithm."
