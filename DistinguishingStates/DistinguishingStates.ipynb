    "- Single-qubit measurements\n",
    "- Distinguishing orthogonal and non-orthogonal states\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should know to start working on this kata:**\n",

    "> 1. You can orchestrate your measurements so that the measurement outcomes, written into the classical register `cr` and converted to an integer using little-endian notation (least significant bit stored first), form the necessary answer. (For this exercise, you'd need to set `cr[0]` to `1` to the value of the bit you want to return.)\n",
    "> 2. You can perform your measurements however you want, and return a classical function that will take the string of measurement outcomes and convert it into an integer result. (See the workbook for an example of this approach.)"
