    "## The concept of a qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic building block of a classical computer is the bit - a single memory cell that is either in state $0$ or in state $1$. Similarly, the basic building block of a quantum computer is the quantum bit, or **qubit**. Like the classical bit, a qubit can be in state $0$ or in state $1$. Unlike the classical bit, however, the qubit isn't limited to just those two states - it may also be in a combination, or **superposition** of those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A common misconception about quantum computing is that a qubit is always in state $1$ or state $0$, and we just don't know which one until we \"measure\" it. That's not the case. A qubit in a superposition is in a linear combination of the states 0 and 1. When a qubit is measured, it's forced to collapse into one state or the other - in other words, measuring a qubit is an irreversible process that changes its initial state.\n",

    "Likewise, a qubit in state $1$ would be represented by this vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Relative and global phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers have a parameter called the phase. If a complex number $z = x + iy$ is written in polar form $z = re^{i\\theta}$, its phase is $\\theta$, where $\\theta = \\mathrm{atan2}(y, x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `atan2` is a useful function available in most programming languages. It takes two arguments and returns an angle $\\theta$\n",

    "> the correct quadrant for the angle, since it preserves information about the signs of both sine and cosine of the angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability amplitudes $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers, therefore $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ have a phase. For example, consider a qubit in state $\\frac{1 + i}{2}\\ket{0} + \\frac{1 - i}{2}\\ket{1}$. If you do the math, you see that the phase of $\\ket{0}$ amplitude is $\\mathrm{atan2}(\\frac12, \\frac12) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, and the phase of $\\ket{1}$ amplitude is $\\mathrm{atan2}(-\\frac12, \\frac12) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The difference between these two phases is known as **relative phase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying the state of the entire system by $e^{i\\theta}$ doesn't affect the relative phase: $\\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1}$ has the same relative phase as $e^{i\\theta}\\big(\\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1}\\big)$. In the second expression, $\\theta$ is known as the system's **global phase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of a qubit (or, more generally, the state of a quantum system) is defined by its relative phase - global phase arises as a consequence of using linear algebra to represent qubits, and has no physical meaning. That is, applying a phase to the entire state of a system (multiplying the entire vector by $e^{i\\theta}$ for any real $\\theta$) doesn't actually affect the state of the system. Because of this, global phase is sometimes known as **unobservable phase** or **hidden phase**."
