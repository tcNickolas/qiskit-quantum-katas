    "The probabilities of the measurement outcomes being $0$ and $1$ are $|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the state of the qubit is modified by the measurement - if the outcome of the measurement is $0$, then the post-measurement state of the qubit is $\\ket{0}$, and if the outcome is $1$, the state is $\\ket{1}$.

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! In this kata you learned to apply measurements to single-qubit systems. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike quantum gates, measurements are neither unitary nor reversible. When we measure a qubit, the state of the qubit collapses to one of the basis states, and the initial state is lost.\n",
    "- Measurements are always done in an orthogonal basis. By default, we choose the computational basis $\\{ \\ket{0}, \\ket{1} \\}$.\n",
    "- Measurements are represented as sets of projector operators, which are matrices.\n",
    "- In Qiskit, you can implement measurements in the computational basis using the `measure` method, which takes a quantum register to be measured and a classical register to write measurement results to."
