# Qiskit Quantum Katas

Qiskit translation of the [Quantum Katas](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/tools/quantum-katas).

## Introduction

The Quantum Katas are a collection of self-paced tutorials and programming exercises to help you learn quantum computing and quantum programming.

* Each kata covers one quantum computing topic, introducing you to the basic concepts and algorithms used in quantum computing. The theoretical concepts are supported with programming exercises.
* Each exercise gives you a task description and a signature of a Python function. Your goal is to implement the function that solves the task.
* The sequence of exercises progresses from easy to hard. The first exercise might require just one line of code or even a single gate, and the later ones might require rather complicated code.
* Each kata has a testing framework that sets up, runs, and validates your solutions. Execute the Jupyter Notebook code cell with yours solution to check whether it is correct. Once your code passes the test, you can move on to the next task.
