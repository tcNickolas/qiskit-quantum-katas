    "## The basics\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, single-qubit gates are represented by $2\\times2$ unitary matrices.\n",
    "The effect of a gate applied to a qubit can be calculated by multiplying the corresponding matrix by the state vector of the qubit to get the resulting state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-qubit gates are represented by $2^N\\times2^N$ matrices, where $N$ is the number of qubits the gate operates on. To apply this gate, you multiply the matrix by the state vector of the $N$-qubit quantum system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying gates to a part of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest thing you can do with multi-qubit systems is to apply gates to only a subset of qubits in the system.\n",
    "Similar to how it is sometimes possible to represent the state of a multi-qubit system as a tensor product of single-qubit states, you can construct gates that modify the state of a multi-qubit system as tensor products of gates that affect parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example of applying a single-qubit gate to one of the qubits of a two-qubit system.\n",
    "If you want to apply an $X$ gate to the first qubit of the system and do nothing to the second qubit, the resulting gate will be represented as a tensor product of an $X$ gate and the identity gate $I$ which corresponds to doing nothing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X \\otimes I =\n",

    "    0 & 1 & 0 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the same approach when applying several gates to independent parts of the system at the same time.\n",
    "For example, applying the $X$ gate to the first qubit and the $H$ gate to the second qubit would be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X \\otimes H =\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that you can use mixed-multiplication property of tensor product to see that this is equivalent to applying $X$ gate to the first qubit and applying $H$ gate to the second qubit, in either order:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$X \\otimes H = (I X) \\otimes (H I) = (I \\otimes H) (X \\otimes I)$$\n",
    "> $$X \\otimes H = (X I) \\otimes (I H) = (X \\otimes I) (I \\otimes H)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be generalized to larger systems and gates that act on multiple qubits as well.\n",
    "It can be less straightforward when a multi-qubit gate is applied to a subset of qubits that aren't \"adjacent\" to each other in the tensor product; you'll see an example later in this kata."

This argument can take integers or bit strings and applies the gate conditionally, if the control register is in the state that matches the argument you passed."

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! In this kata you learned how to apply multi-qubit quantum gates to multi-qubit systems. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applying single-qubit gates to a quantum system can be described as applying a larger multi-qubit gate to the whole system. In this case, this multi-qubit gate can be represented as a tensor product of single-qubit gates.\n",
    "- CNOT gate is a type of controlled gate that acts on two qubits. It applies the $X$ gate to the target qubit if the control qubit is in state $\\ket{1}$, otherwise it does nothing.\n",
    "- SWAP gate is a gate that acts on two qubits, swapping their states.\n",
    "- In Qiskit, controlled gates are either implemented as built-in methods of `QuantumCircuit` class or can be constructed by creating an instance of a `Gate` class and calling its `control` method.\n",
    "- `ctrl_state` argument allows us to use multi-qubit controlled gates with different control patterns."
