In entangled systems, measuring one of the qubits modifies the state of the other qubits, and tells us something about their state.\n",

Notice that each outcome has the same probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. There's zero probability of obtaining $\\ket{01}$ or $\\ket{10}$. If you measure the first qubit and you get that it is in $\\ket{0}$ state, then you can be positive that the second qubit is also in $\\ket{0}$ state, even without measuring it.

For example, each state in the Bell basis is entangled and can be transformed into another Bell state through the application of single-qubit gates.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations!  In this kata you learned the matrix and the ket-bra representation of quantum gates. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single-qubit gates act on individual qubits and are represented by $2 \\times 2$ unitary matrices.\n",
    "- The effect of a gate applied to a qubit can be calculated by multiplying the corresponding matrix by the state vector of the qubit.\n",
    "- Applying several quantum gates in sequence is equivalent to performing several matrix multiplications.\n",
    "- Any square matrix can be represented as a linear combination of the outer products of vectors. The outer product is the matrix product of $\\ket{\\phi}$ and $\\bra{\\psi}$, denoted as $\\ket{\\phi}\\bra{\\psi}$.\n",
    "- Pauli gates, identity and Hadamard gates, phase shift gates, and rotation gates are examples of single-qubit gates. All of them are available in Qiskit."
