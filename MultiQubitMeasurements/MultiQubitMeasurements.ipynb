    "Consider a system consisting of $n\\geq1$ qubits. The wave function of such a system belongs to a vector space of dimension $2^n$. Thus, the vector space is spanned by an orthogonal basis, such as the computational basis which consists of the vectors $\\ket{0\\dotsc0}, \\dotsc, \\ket{1\\dotsc 1}$. For generality, consider an arbitrary orthonormal basis, which is denoted by $\\{ \\ket{b_0}, \\ket{b_1}, \\dotsc, \\ket{b_{2^n-1}} \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ of the multi-qubit system can be expressed as a linear combination of the $2^n$ basis vectors $\\ket{b_i}$. That is, there exist complex numbers $c_0,c_1,\\dotsc, c_{2^n-1}$ such that\n",

    "## Measuring each qubit in a system sequentially\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the previous sections, in theory it's possible to measure all the qubits in an $n$-qubit system simultaneously in an orthogonal basis. The post-measurement state of the qubits is then exactly one of the $2^n$ possible basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is implemented by measuring all the qubits one after another. For example, if one wants to measure a two-qubit system in the computational basis, one can implement this by first measuring the first qubit in the computational basis to obtain $0$ or $1$, and then measuring the second qubit in the computational basis. This can result in one of the four possible outcomes: $00, 01, 10, 11$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be generalized to measurements in other bases, such as the 2-qubit Pauli X basis $\\ket{++}, \\ket{+-}, \\ket{-+}, \\ket{--}$, and the bases for larger numbers of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that measurement of all qubits sequentially can only be done in orthogonal bases $\\{ \\ket{b_i}\\}$, such that each $\\ket{b_i}$ is a **tensor product state**. That is, each $\\ket{b_i}$ must be of the form $\\ket{v_0} \\otimes \\ket{v_1} \\dotsc \\otimes \\ket{v_{n-1}}$, with each $\\ket{v_j}$ being a single-qubit basis state.\n",
    "For example, for the two-qubit Pauli X basis $\\ket{++}, \\ket{+-}, \\ket{-+}, \\ket{--}$ each basis state is a tensor product of states $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$, which form a single-qubit basis state.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Measuring in orthogonal bases which contain states which aren't tensor product states, such as the Bell basis, are trickier to implement, and require appropriate unitary rotations in addition to measuring all qubits one after another.\n",
    "> Such measurements aren't discussed in this kata.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If measurements are restricted to tensor product states, the distinction between measuring all the qubits simultaneously versus one after another is not important for an ideal quantum computer: in terms of the outcomes and measurement probabilities, both approaches are identical. Furthermore, as long as all the qubits are measured, the sequence in which they are measured is also inconsequential. These factors can be important in the case of real quantum computers with imperfect qubits, but the discussion in this kata is limited to ideal systems."

    "## Measurements and entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "Entanglement has an effect on the measurement statistics of the system. If two qubits are entangled, then their measurement outcomes will be correlated, while separable states (which are by definition not entangled) have uncorrelated measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's useful to revisit the concepts of entanglement and separable states, which were introduced in the \"Multi-Qubit Systems\" kata. Consider a system of $n>1$ qubits, which is divided into two parts: A, consisting of $m$ qubits, and B, consisting of the remaining $n-m$ qubits. The state $\\ket \\psi$ of the entire system is separable if it can be expressed as a tensor product of the states of parts A and B:\n",
    "> $$\\ket \\psi = \\ket {\\phi_A} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_B}$$\n",
    "> Here $\\ket{\\phi_A}$ and $\\ket{\\phi_B}$ are wave functions that describe parts $A$ and $B$, respectively. If it isn't possible to express $\\ket \\psi$ in such a form, then system A is entangled with system B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a measurement on the subsystem $A$ of a separable state. Let the measurement be done in a basis $\\{ \\ket{b_0},\\dotsc,\\ket{b_{2^m-1}}\\}$. According to the projection formalism, a projection operator $P_i = \\ket{b_i}\\bra{b_i} \\otimes \\mathbb{1}$ is chosen randomly. The corresponding post-measurement state of the system is then given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi}_{i} \\equiv \\frac{P_i \\ket{\\psi}}{\\big|P_i \\ket{\\psi}\\big|}\n",
    "= \\frac{ \\ket{b_i} \\braket{b_i|\\phi_A} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_B} }{\\big| \\ket{b_i}\\braket{b_i|\\phi_A} \\otimes \\ket {\\phi_B} \\big|}=$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= \\frac{\\braket{b_i|\\phi_A} \\cdot \\ket{b_i} \\otimes \\ket {\\phi_B}}{\\big|\\ket{b_i}\\big| \\cdot \\braket{b_i|\\phi_A} \\cdot \\big| \\ket {\\phi_B}\\big|}\n",
    "= \\ket{b_i} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_B}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the state of subsystem $B$ after the measurement is $\\ket{\\phi_B}$ independently of the outcome $i$ of the measurement on the first qubit. The results of a subsequent measurement on subsystem $B$, including outcome probabilities, will be independent of the result of the first measurement. In other words, the outcomes of the two measurements will be uncorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the system is entangled, then the measurement outcomes will be correlated, in a manner dictated by the bases chosen for the measurements on the two subsystems. The following exercise illustrates this phenomenon.\n",

    "- A state $\\ket \\Theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( \\ket{00} + \\ket{01} + \\ket{10} + \\ket{11} \\big)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both states, consider a measurement on the first qubit, followed by a measurement on the second qubit, both done in the computational basis. For which state can you expect the measurement outcomes to be correlated? Verify by calculating the sequential measurement probabilities explicitly for both states.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The Bell state</b>: If the measurement outcome on the first qubit is $0$, a subsequent measurement on the second qubit <i>always</i> results in an outcome of $0$, with probability $1$. Similarly, if the measurement outcome on the first qubit is $1$, then the second qubit measurement always results in $1$. Thus, sequential measurements are perfectly <b>correlated</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Separable state $\\ket \\Theta$</b>: Irrespective of whether the first qubit measurement outcome is $0$ of $1$ (each of which occurs with a probability of $0.5$), a subsequent measurement on the second qubit results in an outcome of $0$ or $1$ (both with a probability of $0.5$). Thus, sequential measurements are perfectly <b>uncorrelated</b>.\n",
    "\n",
